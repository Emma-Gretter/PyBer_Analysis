# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the performance of the PyBer ridesharing app in different markets; specifically urban, rural, and suburban areas. 

## Results
The analysis found that
-	PyBer has the most drivers in urban areas and the least drivers in rural areas.
-	PyBer has the most riders in urban areas and the least riders in rural areas.
-	PyBer rides are the most expensive in rural areas and the least expensive in urban areas.
-	PyBer earned the most in total fares in urban areas and the least in rural areas. 
-	The average fare per driver in rural areas was more than three times as much as the average fare per driver in urban areas. 
-	PyBer fares remained steady over time throughout the year in 2019.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, PyBer should consider slightly restricting the number of drivers in urban areas. Currently, PyBer has one and a half times as many drivers as it does riders. This disparity in drivers and riders is driving down fares and resulting in low wages for drivers. PyBer should work to increase the number of drivers in rural areas where the number of riders outnumbers drivers nearly two to one. PyBer should implement standardized pricing to ensure that drivers in each area type are earning similar wage and that riders can better estimate the cost of each ride in advance.
